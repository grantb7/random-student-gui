# random-student-gui
## Description
This is a MATLAB GUI program that allows professors to call on students randomly in class. In my experience this enhances participation and engagement. The GUI shows some statistics and allows the professor to grade the students response as "Correct" or "Incorrect". The professor also has the option to skip that particular student.

## Disclaimer
This is a work in progress and still needs a lot of work. Currently the program is functional but some functionalities are not implemented yet. If you are interested in helping, let me know and I'll put you to work!
